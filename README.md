# In Brief
Harry J. Paarsch

I am an applied economist and data scientist, and Professor of Business Analytics in the College of Business at the University of Central Florida in
Orlando, Florida.  Since 2015, I have been developing data science courses and programs in general, but business analytics ones in particular.  My 
position was created as a result of a recent strategic hiring initiative by UCF to fulfill a critical role in developing undergraduate and masterâ€™s-level
programs in business analytics to be delivered in collaboration with its Department of Statistics and Data Science.  Prior to working at UCF, for three
years, I was employed as a principal economist at Amazon.com in Seattle.  Prior to that I was employed at the universities of British Columbia and Western
Ontario as well as the universities of Iowa and Melbourne.
